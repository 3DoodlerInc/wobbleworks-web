<p><strong>Shine the Light</strong></p>
<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the &ldquo;Shine The Light&rdquo; law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of Personal Information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties to which we disclosed Personal Information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.</p>
<p><strong>Your California Rights</strong></p>
<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the following rights with respect to the Personal Information we process about you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Right to Know and Access. </strong>You may have the right to request information about the categories of Personal Information we have collected about you, the categories of sources from which we collected the Personal Information, the purposes for collecting, selling, or sharing the Personal Information, and the categories of third parties to whom we have disclosed your Personal Information, and the specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you.</li>

<p><strong>Exercising Your California Rights</strong></p>
<p>Please contact us using the information provided in the &ldquo;Contact Us&rdquo; section below to exercise your rights.</p>
<p>You can designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with applicable law.</p>
<p>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.</p>
<p>We will only use Personal Information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification.
